# Introduction
This application is created with pure TypeScript only.
It just a playground to try out native TypeScript and browser features.

To start the application after a git clone, use:

npm run install-and-start

# Dependencies
- Concurrently - We need concurrently, because we need to run the frontend watch and backend watch in parallel.
- Karma - Frontend unit testing, integration testing and end to end testing
